Sharon Poshmark is a Chrome extension for sharing listings on Poshmark. It was created by me, [Bianca Ragsdale](https://www.linkedin.com/in/biancaragsdale/). I'm a full-time technical writer and a lifelong learner. 

You can download Sharon Poshmark for free from the Google Chrome Store [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sharon-poshmark/eodccgdhbjjbkkbmailnjbbhhcnclkhe?hl=en-GB).

Or, you can download this repo and load the extension in developer mode. To learn how to do this, check out Google's [documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).
