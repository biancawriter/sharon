Sharon Poshmark is a Chrome extension for sharing listings on Poshmark. 

It was created by me, [Bianca Ragsdale](https://www.linkedin.com/in/biancaragsdale/). I'm a full-time technical writer and a lifelong learner. I created this extension to showcase my HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub skills. I also developed it to sovle a practical problem that I encountered with reselling on Poshmark, one of my hobbies. I won't bore you with the details, but trust meâ€”-this extension has saved me hours of time! Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/FQCCf1sM-a4) tutorial to understand how.

You can download Sharon Poshmark for free from the Google Chrome Store [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sharon-poshmark/eodccgdhbjjbkkbmailnjbbhhcnclkhe?hl=en-GB).
